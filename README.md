# Twitter-Analytics-Dashboard
As a part of internship, i have created a 'Twitter Analytics Dashboard" using the dataset "SocialMedia.csv" provided above.

I've been able to understand 'DAX Queries' and apply it in the ETL process. Further i have used different type of charts and be able to complete the project.

**Outcomes & Impact**
1. Created a real-time, user-friendly dashboard with meaningful Twitter metrics
2. Gained insights into engagement timing, click distribution, and content performance
3. Improved ability to model and transform data using advanced DAX expressions
4. Delivered a clean, intuitive BI solution for data storytelling and reporting
